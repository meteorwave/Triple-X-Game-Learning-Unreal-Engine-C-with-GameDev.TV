# Triple-X-Game-Learning-Unreal-Engine-C-with-GameDev.TV
This is a project for an Udemy class with GameDev.TV where we are learning to program in C++ and Unreal Engine.  We are supposed to program a C++ game from scratch where the user will have to guess a 3 digit code based on the sum &amp; product of the 3 digits.  We have to introduce a random number generating line of code to the program.
